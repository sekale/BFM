Explains BFM and how the blocks are connected in concise details. The thing that we do different from them is that our clock is generated in the testbench,
whereas theirs is used from the BFM. We need to simulate clock in test bench because that's where student write their code and use this BFM just as functions essentially.

This will still give an insight as to how they are created.
